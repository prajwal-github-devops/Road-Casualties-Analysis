Road Casualties Analysis | Excel
Project Overview
This project involved analyzing road accident data to identify patterns, trends, and key factors contributing to road casualties. The analysis aimed to assist in developing data-driven strategies for improving road safety and reducing accident rates. Excel was used for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.

Key Features
Data Analysis:
Performed data cleaning and preprocessing to handle missing or inconsistent data.
Conducted analysis on factors such as time, location, and vehicle type to identify trends.
Visualizations:
Created pivot tables and charts to highlight trends in accident severity, casualty types, and frequency.
Designed dashboards summarizing key metrics such as accident hotspots and peak accident times.
Insights:
Identified high-risk areas and times for road accidents.
Highlighted the correlation between accident severity and vehicle type.
Provided actionable recommendations to reduce road casualties.
Tools and Technologies
Excel: Pivot tables, advanced functions, conditional formatting, and data visualization tools.
Dataset Source
Road accident dataset containing details about accidents, locations, severity, vehicle types, and casualty information.
Project Highlights
Accident Hotspots: Identified locations with the highest frequency of road accidents.
Peak Times: Analyzed time-of-day and day-of-week trends to determine peak accident times.
Severity Analysis: Explored the relationship between accident severity and contributing factors, including weather and vehicle type.
Future Scope
Integrate additional datasets (e.g., weather, traffic data) for deeper analysis.
Develop predictive models for accident risk based on historical data.
Create an interactive dashboard using Power BI for real-time monitoring of accident trends.
